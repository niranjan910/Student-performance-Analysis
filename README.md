# Business Problem

In todayâ€™s education system, multiple factors such as study habits, attendance, parental involvement, and demographic backgrounds significantly impact student performance. The school board has collected extensive data from various schools to uncover these patterns.

The core challenge is to identify the key drivers of student performance and detect students at risk of underperforming. This will enable proactive, data-driven decisions to enhance learning outcomes, optimize academic support, and allocate resources effectively.

# Project Background

This project analyzes educational data to understand the influence of various factors on student exam scores. The goal is to translate raw data into actionable insights that improve academic achievement and support vulnerable students.

Key focus areas include:  
- Study habits and attendance  
- Parental involvement and socio-economic background  
- Access to resources and learning disabilities  
- School and teacher quality  

Using exploratory data analysis (EDA) and predictive modeling, this project identifies which factors most impact student success and builds a model to forecast exam scores.

# Data Structure & Initial Checks

The dataset contains the following key features:

- **Hours_Studied:** Number of hours spent studying  
- **Attendance:** Attendance rate (%)  
- **Parental_Involvement:** Level of parental engagement  
- **Access_to_Resources:** Availability of learning resources  
- **Sleep_Hours:** Average sleep hours  
- **Previous_Scores:** Past academic scores  
- **Motivation_Level:** Self-reported motivation  
- **Internet_Access:** Availability of internet at home  
- **Tutoring_Sessions:** Number of tutoring sessions attended  
- **Family_Income:** Family income bracket  
- **Teacher_Quality:** Rating of teacher effectiveness  
- **School_Type:** Public or private school  
- **Learning_Disabilities:** Presence of disabilities affecting learning  
- **Parental_Education_Level:** Highest education level of parents  
- **Exam_Score:** Target variable representing student exam results

# Executive Summary

### Key Findings

- Study habits (hours studied) and attendance show strong positive correlations with exam scores.  
- Parental involvement and teacher quality also significantly influence performance.  
- Students with learning disabilities or limited access to resources tend to underperform.  
- Sleep and motivation levels impact exam results but to a lesser extent.  
- Family income and parental education level affect performance indirectly via resource availability and support.  

### Model Results

A linear regression model was trained to predict exam scores using the selected features. The model achieved reasonable accuracy, providing a solid baseline for forecasting student performance and identifying at-risk students.

# Recommendations

Based on analysis and modeling, it is recommended to:  
- Encourage consistent study routines and improve attendance monitoring.  
- Increase parental involvement programs and resource accessibility.  
- Provide targeted support for students with learning disabilities.  
- Invest in teacher training to raise instructional quality.  
- Monitor student sleep and motivation to identify potential issues early.  

These actions can help improve overall student outcomes and tailor interventions effectively.

# Assumptions and Caveats

- Missing data was handled by appropriate cleaning and imputation techniques.  
- Categorical variables were encoded to suit modeling requirements.  
- The model assumes linear relationships between features and exam scores; non-linear patterns might require more complex models.  
- External factors like curriculum differences or socio-cultural influences are not captured.
